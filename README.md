1/4/10/1

[[Jean Laplanche]] crafted an hypothesis/redefinition of the [[unconscious|Psychoanalytic unconscious]] by means of a %[[General seduction theory]] that resembles but ultimately goes against Lacan's conception of the unconscious' origin and foundations% @[[General seduction theory]] opposes [[Lacanian subject]]@ by building a well-defined [[etiology|Etiology]] and proposing more clear connections between his etiology and actual [[symptoms as they appear clinically|Unconscious formations]].
In a sense, this means @[[Jean Laplanche]] is a rival of [[Jacques Lacan]]@, albeit one highly indebted to the later.

@is useful for@ [[Testing psychoanalysis]]
@example of@ [[Well-formed psychoanalytic unconscious hypothesis]]
